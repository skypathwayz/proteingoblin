# Why DNS Check Happens Every Time

## This is Normal! ✅

GitHub Pages runs a DNS check **every time** you visit the settings page. This is expected behavior.

### Why GitHub Does This:
1. **Real-time Verification**: GitHub wants to ensure your DNS is still correctly configured
2. **Detect Changes**: If you change DNS settings, GitHub will detect it immediately
3. **Certificate Status**: GitHub uses this check to determine if SSL certificate can be issued
4. **Security**: Ensures the domain is still pointing to GitHub Pages

### What You're Seeing:
1. Page loads → "DNS Check in Progress" (orange warning)
2. After 2-5 seconds → Green checkmark appears
3. This happens EVERY time you refresh the page

### This is NOT a Problem:
- ✅ DNS is working correctly (that's why it turns green)
- ✅ This is automatic verification by GitHub
- ✅ You don't need to do anything
- ✅ The SSL certificate will still be issued (separate process)

### When to Worry:
❌ If the check stays orange/red for more than 5 minutes
❌ If it shows an error message
❌ If the green checkmark never appears

### Your Current Status:
✅ DNS check completes successfully (turns green)
✅ This means your DNS is configured correctly
⏳ SSL certificate is still being issued (takes 5-60 minutes, separate from DNS check)

## The SSL Certificate Process:
1. DNS Check (what you see turning green) - happens every page load
2. Certificate Issuance (happens once) - takes 5-60 minutes in the background
3. Certificate Activation - happens automatically when ready

You're in step 2 - waiting for the certificate to be issued. The DNS check turning green is confirmation that everything is set up correctly!

## Bottom Line:
**This is normal GitHub behavior - nothing is broken!** The DNS check running each time is GitHub verifying your setup is still correct. You're all good! 👍
