# Recipe Image Mapping - Need Unique Images

## Current Situation
- **Total Recipes:** 157 recipes
- **Available Images:** ~40 unique images
- **Requirement:** Each recipe needs its own unique image used only once

## Problem
Many recipes are sharing the same images. For example:
- `birthday cake.webp` is used 31 times
- `Protein-Cheesecake-vanilla.jpg` is used 20 times
- `peanut-butter-protein-balls.jpg` is used 15 times

## Solution Needed
You need to provide **117+ more unique images** OR we can use a placeholder system until you provide them.

## Recipes Currently Sharing Images

## Next Steps
1. Either provide 117+ unique recipe images
2. OR I can create a system that uses unique placeholder emojis/icons for each recipe until images are provided
3. OR we can prioritize the most important recipes first and get images for those
