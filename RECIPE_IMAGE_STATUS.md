# Recipe Image Status - CRITICAL ISSUE

## ⚠️ Current Problem
**157 recipes** are using only **~40 unique images**, meaning most recipes share images with others.

## Analysis Results

### Most Overused Images:
1. **`birthday cake.webp`** - Used by **31 different recipes**
2. **`Protein-Cheesecake-vanilla.jpg`** - Used by **20 different recipes**  
3. **`peanut-butter-protein-balls.jpg`** - Used by **15 different recipes**

8. **`vanilla pancakes.jpg`** - Used by **10 different recipes**
9. **`scrambled eggs.jpeg`** - Used by **10 different recipes**

## Solution Required

### Option 1: Provide 117+ Unique Images
You need to provide **117+ additional unique recipe images** so each recipe can have its own unique image.

### Option 2: Use Placeholder System
I can create a system that uses unique emoji/icon combinations for each recipe until you provide actual images. This would be temporary but functional.

### Option 3: Prioritize Top Recipes First
Get unique images for the most important/popular recipes first, then expand.

## What I CANNOT Do
I **cannot search the web and download images** automatically. You will need to:
1. Provide the images yourself, OR
2. Tell me specific image URLs to use, OR  
3. Use the placeholder system temporarily

## Ready for Your Images
When you provide the images, place them in `images-backup/` and tell me:
- Image filename
- Which recipe(s) it should be used for
- I'll update the mapping immediately

## Current Status
- ✅ Mascots added to all pages
- ❌ Recipe images still need to be made unique (117+ recipes sharing images)
