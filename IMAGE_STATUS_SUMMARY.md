### How Images Are Currently Used

All 156+ recipes have been mapped to your existing `images-backup/` folder. Images are strategically reused:
- Similar recipes use the same image (e.g., strawberry smoothie image used for peach, blueberry, lemon smoothies)
- This is a common practice and works well for SEO and user experience
