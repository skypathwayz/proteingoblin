# HTTPS Setup Guide for GitHub Pages

## Current Status
✅ Custom domain configured: proteingoblin.com
✅ DNS check successful (green checkmark)
⏳ Waiting for SSL certificate to be issued by GitHub

## What to Do

### Step 1: Wait for Certificate (5-60 minutes, sometimes up to 24 hours)
GitHub automatically provisions SSL certificates for custom domains. This happens automatically once:
- Custom domain is configured ✓ (You've done this)
- DNS is pointing correctly ✓ (You've done this)

### Step 2: Check Certificate Status
1. Go to: https://github.com/skypathwayz/proteingoblin/settings/pages
2. Look at the "Enforce HTTPS" section
3. When the certificate is ready, you'll see:
   - ✅ "Enforce HTTPS" checkbox will become available (not grayed out)
   - ✅ The warning message will disappear
   - ✅ You can then check the box to enable HTTPS

### Step 3: Enable HTTPS Once Available
Once the certificate is issued:
1. ✅ Check the "Enforce HTTPS" box in GitHub Pages settings
2. ✅ Click "Save"
3. Your site will automatically redirect HTTP → HTTPS
4. The SSL certificate error will disappear

## Timeline
- **Fastest**: 5-15 minutes (if DNS propagated quickly)
- **Normal**: 15-60 minutes
- **Slow**: Up to 24 hours (rare)

## What's Already Fixed (Code Side)
✅ Removed all client-side HTTPS redirects (these were causing errors)
✅ Site now works on HTTP without errors
✅ Once you enable HTTPS in GitHub, it will work automatically

## Important Notes
- **DO NOT** check "Enforce HTTPS" until the checkbox becomes available
- The site works fine on HTTP right now (users can access it)
- Once you enable HTTPS in GitHub settings, GitHub will handle the redirect
- You don't need to add any code - GitHub does it server-side

## How to Know Certificate is Ready
Check the GitHub Pages settings page. When ready:
- The warning will say something like "HTTPS provides encryption..."
- The checkbox will be clickable (not grayed out)
- There will be no error messages

## If Certificate Takes Too Long
If it's been more than 24 hours:
1. Remove the custom domain (click "Remove")
2. Wait 5 minutes
3. Re-add it (enter proteingoblin.com again)
4. Click "Save"
5. This will trigger a fresh certificate request

## Current Workaround
Your site is fully functional on HTTP:
- ✅ Users can access: http://proteingoblin.com
- ⚠️ HTTPS will show certificate errors until you enable it in GitHub
- Once certificate is issued and enabled, both HTTP and HTTPS will work
