# HTTPS "Not Secure" Warning - Troubleshooting Guide

## Why You're Still Seeing "Not Secure"

Even after enabling "Enforce HTTPS" in GitHub Pages, you might still see "Not Secure" because:

### 1. **Browser Cache (Most Common)**
Your browser has cached the HTTP version of the site.

**Fix:**
- **Chrome:** Press `Cmd+Shift+R` (Mac) or `Ctrl+Shift+R` (Windows) to hard refresh
- **Safari:** Press `Cmd+Option+R` to hard refresh
- Or clear cache: Settings ‚Üí Privacy ‚Üí Clear browsing data ‚Üí Cached images and files

### 2. **You're Still Accessing via HTTP**
Type `https://proteingoblin.com` directly (not `http://`).

**Check:**
- Open a new incognito/private window
- Type: `https://proteingoblin.com`
- Does it show a lock icon? ‚úÖ Then HTTPS is working!

### 3. **GitHub Redirect Delay**
GitHub's HTTPS enforcement can take 5-30 minutes to fully propagate.

**What to check:**
1. Go to: https://github.com/skypathwayz/proteingoblin/settings/pages
2. Verify "Enforce HTTPS" checkbox is ‚úÖ checked
3. If it just got enabled, wait 5-30 minutes

### 4. **Certificate Not Fully Validated**
The certificate exists but browser hasn't validated it yet.

**Fix:**
- Close ALL browser tabs with your site
- Clear browser cache
- Open fresh tab and type: `https://proteingoblin.com`

## Quick Diagnostic Steps

### Step 1: Check HTTPS Enforcement Status
```
Go to: https://github.com/skypathwayz/proteingoblin/settings/pages
Look for: "Enforce HTTPS" checkbox
Status should be: ‚úÖ Checked
```

### Step 2: Test HTTPS Directly
1. Open new incognito window (bypasses cache)
2. Type: `https://proteingoblin.com`
3. Look for üîí lock icon in address bar

### Step 3: Check for Mixed Content
1. Open browser Developer Tools (F12)
2. Go to Console tab
3. Look for errors like "Mixed Content" or "HTTP resources"

### Step 4: Verify DNS Propagation
```
Run in terminal:
curl -I https://proteingoblin.com

Should return:
HTTP/2 200 (or similar)
Not: HTTP/1.1 or connection errors
```

## Common Solutions

### Solution 1: Hard Refresh (Try This First!)
```
Chrome/Firefox: Cmd+Shift+R (Mac) or Ctrl+Shift+R (Windows)
Safari: Cmd+Option+R
```

### Solution 2: Clear Browser Cache
```
Chrome:
1. Settings ‚Üí Privacy and security ‚Üí Clear browsing data
2. Select "Cached images and files"
3. Time range: "Last hour"
4. Click "Clear data"

Safari:
1. Safari ‚Üí Preferences ‚Üí Privacy
2. Click "Manage Website Data"
3. Remove proteingoblin.com
4. Click "Done"
```

### Solution 3: Test in Incognito/Private Window
```
1. Open new incognito window (Cmd+Shift+N / Ctrl+Shift+N)
2. Type: https://proteingoblin.com
3. This bypasses all cache and extensions
```

### Solution 4: Wait for Propagation
```
If you JUST enabled HTTPS enforcement:
‚è±Ô∏è Wait 5-30 minutes
üîÑ Clear cache
üîÑ Try again
```

## If Still Not Working

### Check GitHub Pages Status
1. Go to: https://github.com/skypathwayz/proteingoblin/settings/pages
2. Look for any error messages
3. Check if "Enforce HTTPS" is still checked

### Check Certificate Status
1. Open: https://proteingoblin.com
2. Click the lock icon (or "Not Secure") in address bar
3. Click "Certificate"
4. Should show:
   - ‚úÖ Valid certificate
   - ‚úÖ Issued by: Let's Encrypt or GitHub
   - ‚úÖ Valid from: Today's date

### Force HTTPS Redirect (Last Resort)
If GitHub's redirect isn't working, we can add a meta tag to force HTTPS.

## Verification Checklist

- [ ] "Enforce HTTPS" is checked in GitHub Pages settings
- [ ] You're accessing `https://proteingoblin.com` (not `http://`)
- [ ] Hard refreshed browser (Cmd+Shift+R)
- [ ] Tested in incognito window
- [ ] Certificate shows as valid in browser
- [ ] No mixed content errors in console
- [ ] Waited 5-30 minutes after enabling HTTPS

## Expected Behavior

‚úÖ **What you SHOULD see:**
- üîí Lock icon in address bar
- URL shows: `https://proteingoblin.com`
- No "Not Secure" warning
- Site loads normally

‚ùå **What you SHOULDN'T see:**
- ‚ö†Ô∏è "Not Secure" warning
- üî¥ Red lock icon
- Mixed content warnings
- Certificate errors

## Still Having Issues?

If after trying all these steps it still shows "Not Secure":
1. Check if the site loads on `http://` (should redirect to HTTPS)
2. Check browser console for errors (F12 ‚Üí Console)
3. Take a screenshot of the certificate details
4. Share the errors you're seeing

The most common fix is: **Hard refresh (Cmd+Shift+R) after waiting 5-30 minutes for GitHub's redirect to propagate.**
